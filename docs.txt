what is the purpose of your application
- it is a casual game where you have to guess a word and the only information you are given at the start is the alphabetical order of each letter in the word.

what data is being stored and delivered by the api
- the list of words used by the game and each user's settings and words they have won with

what did you learn while developing this project

If you were to continue, what would you do to improve your application?
- i would add some sort of score so a player can see how well they did. i would also add a way to share how you did with a word similar to how wordle uses emojis

If you went above and beyond, how did you do so?
- i used firebase to store the word list and user data

If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from?
What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code?
